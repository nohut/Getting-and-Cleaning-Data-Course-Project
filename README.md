Getting and Cleaning Data Project Assignment.
==================================================================
This project's purpose is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Activity label for the experiment
- Average of each variable (collection of standart deviations and means) for each activity and each subject.


The project includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt': Information about the contents of the dataset provided.

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the script used for getting and cleaning the data. It also provides information about the column names of the output file.

- 'run_analysis.R': R script for getting and cleaning the data.

- 'run_analysis_output.txt': Output file containing the tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
